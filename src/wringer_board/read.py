# **The acceptance versions this board understands** (ruling 6, amended
# 2026-08-16). The spec named `wringer.acceptance.v1` alone, because v2 did not
# exist when it was written. It does now — a run carrying a witness lane writes
# v2, and the corpus re-test this board's first real render is built from is
# exactly such a run. Rendering only v1 would mean the board could not show the
# very artifact it was commissioned to show.
#
# v2 is a superset in the only two ways that matter here: a row gains an
# optional `witness` object, and `gate` may be null on a row that still
# `refuses`. Both are handled explicitly below. **The rule ruling 6 actually
# states is unchanged**: anything not on this list produces a banner naming the
# version and NO CARDS AT ALL — not best-effort parsing, not partial rendering.
# v3 adds three keys per row and takes nothing away: `cause` (which of eight
# named conditions put the row where it is), `demonstrated_able_to_fail`
# (three-valued), and `judgement` (a person's answer to a `human` criterion).
# All three are handled explicitly below.
#
# **This board learned v3 from bytes the ENGINE wrote**, not from fixtures
# written here — `tests/test_acceptance_v3.py` reads
# `schema/fixtures/acceptance-v3-*.json` out of the core repository, which the
# core regenerates from `accept.Result.as_json_v3` on every run of its own
# suite. A fixture written from the same guess as its reader is how a surface
# comes to agree with itself and with nothing else, and this repository has
# already paid for that once: eleven mutations walked through an absence guard
# whose fixtures and whose reader shared one author's assumption.
