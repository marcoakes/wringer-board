"""The interview surface — SPEC_BOARD_V0 §5 ruling 20 (S3).

**A pen, not a new channel.** Three capabilities, each writing exactly what a
hand-edit writes today, into `wringer.spec.yaml` and nothing else:

1. **The conversation over `open_questions`** — an answer lands as an `answer:`
   under its question, in the shape the core's spec loader already reads
   (`spec.Spec.unanswered`). `wring plan` reports what is still unanswered and
   REFUSES; that refusal is rendered, never pre-empted.
2. **The plain-language plan** — *here is what I will build, and here is how I
   will prove each piece* — rendered from the approved spec's criteria and the
   gate sidecar's `proves:` bindings.
3. **The approve action**, which writes `approved: true` and nothing else.

**Three refusals, all structural.**

- **There is no `--yes` equivalent and this surface does not become one.** The
  whole point of the approval step is that a person read what is about to be
  built. A button clicked after reading a rendered plan is that same act; a
  button that approves WITHOUT rendering the plan is not, and `approve`
  therefore prints the plan and requires the reader to name what they read.
- **Approving and answering a question are never the same action.** Two verbs,
  two files' worth of edit, and neither reaches the other.
- **This module never writes `.wringer/`, never writes a judgement, and never
  touches a gate.** `wringer.judgements.yaml` in particular is a person's own
  file with no writer anywhere in either repository — see the core's
  `test_no_flag_no_env_var_and_no_command_can_write_a_judgement`. A surface
  that could answer a `human` criterion would be the thing this programme
  exists to answer.

**Byte equality is the test** (B5): drive the verb and the hand edit against
the same fixture and the resulting files are identical. That is why the writes
here are line edits to the existing text rather than a YAML round-trip — a
round-trip reformats comments, key order and quoting, so it could not be
byte-equal to what a person would have typed, and the person's file is the
artifact of record.

#
#     approved: false        # <- the interlock. `wring plan` refuses while this is false.
#
# (`wringer/src/wringer/spec.py`). The first version of this pattern ended
# `\s*$`, so it matched a hand-written `approved: false` and REFUSED every spec
# the engine itself drafts — with the message "it does not invent structure",
# which reads as a caller bug and is not one. It was never caught because this
# package's fixture was hand-typed, i.e. written on the same side of the seam
# as the reader. That is the identical failure mode that let eleven mutations
# through this repository's absence guard, and it is why the fixture in
# `test_interview.py` is now `spec.render()`'s real output.
#
# The comment is CAPTURED and written back verbatim: it is the sentence that
# tells a person what the flag does, and a surface that silently deleted it
# while flipping the flag would be removing the explanation of the thing it
# just did.
# **Every YAML 1.1 boolean the ENGINE accepts, and the engine is what decides.**
# `false`, `no` and `off` all read as the boolean false in PyYAML, and
# `spec.load` on `approved: no` returns a perfectly valid unapproved spec. The
# pattern matched only `true|false`, so `approve` fell out of its loop on the
# others and told the person their file *"has no top-level `approved:` line to
# set"* — about a line sitting in front of them.
#
# That is the SECOND time this exact sentence has been wrong, for the same
# underlying reason, and the note below records the first. Both times the
# fixtures were written on the same side of the seam as the reader.
#
# `y`/`n` are deliberately absent: PyYAML reads them as the strings "y"/"n",
# so the engine refuses such a spec first with "'approved' must be a boolean".

    afterwards: the document a person approved then changed underneath them,
    with the approval still standing and nothing said.
