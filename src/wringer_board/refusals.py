"""Plain language for every named thing the engine can say. SPEC_BOARD_V0 §4.

**Ruling 16 — the mapping is total, keyed on `(family, value)`, and totality is
forced by a test.** Every named value the shipped engine can emit gets exactly
one PM sentence and exactly one unblocking question. The key is a pair and not
a bare value because `unevidenced` alone has five causes, and one sentence for
five facts is precisely the collapse ruling 15 exists to prevent.

**Ruling 17 — an unmapped value renders UNTRANSLATED**, with the engine's own
words, verbatim. Never invisibly, never swallowed, never best-effort
prettified: *a PM seeing an ugly string files a bug report; a PM seeing nothing
has been lied to.*

**Ruling 18 — this file translates and never negotiates.** There is no entry
here that softens a refusal, no "proceed anyway", and no value whose sentence
tells a reader the thing did not matter. A refusal rendered in plain language
is still a refusal.

**The unblocking question is one question.** Not a list, not a diagnosis, and
never a command to run — the board is read by someone who does not use a
terminal. Where the honest answer is that only an engineer can move it, the
question says so rather than inventing an action for the reader.

## Where these values come from, and the one honest weakness

Five families are enumerable from FROZEN SCHEMAS, which is the strongest source
this project has — a schema is a published contract and `schema/frozen.json`
byte-freezes it. Three are enumerable only from public module symbols
(`graph.LOOP_REASONS`, `sign.SIGNATURE_STATES`, `sign.IDENTITY_STATES`,
`sign.INTEGRITY_STATES`).

This package has **no runtime dependency on `wringer`** and will not gain one:
B1's structural test asserts the surface ships nothing it does not need, and a
renderer that cannot run without the engine installed is a worse product. So
the values are written down here, and `tests/test_refusals.py` cross-checks
every one of them against the engine's own symbols and schemas **whenever the
engine is importable** — which it is wherever this is developed or its CI runs.

The weakness, stated rather than hidden: on a machine with no `wringer`
installed, that cross-check cannot run, and this file is then a hand-kept list.
The test says so out loud instead of skipping quietly, because a guard that
goes silent is how the last three stale claims in this programme survived.

**`sign.INTEGRITY_STATES` is now a real tuple** (`ab884b5`), so the per-value
exemption ruling 16 granted the two integrity values — on the stated grounds
that no collection existed — is discharged. They are enumerated like their two
siblings and the exemption is gone rather than left as a comment.
