"""One screen, one file. SPEC_BOARD_V0 §3 and §7.

Static-first and self-contained: inline CSS, no network, no fonts to fetch, no
server. B1 — the layer is local and single-user — and the probe's single HTML
file is the existence proof this is enough.

**B4, the copy ceiling.** No YAML, no exit codes, no paths, no gate ids, no run
ids in the board's own chrome. Two deliberate exceptions, both on the card and
both because removing them costs the PM information they need: the message the
check printed, verbatim in a block attributed to the check, and the attempt
ordinal with its timestamp. Everything else technical lives in one page-level
collapsed block addressed to engineers.

**The Q1 ceiling, which no string here may exceed:** a witness proves the
stated criterion could fail and was made to pass; it does not certify agreement
with an unstated intended fix. Nothing on this page may say the check catches
wrong fixes.
