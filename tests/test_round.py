"""S2, second half — the seven families that are not a criterion, on the page.

The mapping was total after S2's first commit and **seven of its ten families
reached no page at all**: loop endings, vacuity verdicts, health verdicts,
signature, identity, integrity and fleet outcomes. `docs/BOARD_S2.md` said so
in its own "what did NOT land" section rather than claiming the slice. This
file is that section being discharged.

**The test that matters most in here is not the seven that render a sentence.**
It is `test_a_missing_artifact_renders_NOTHING_about_its_family`: a mapping
that renders `signature_missing` because it found no signature would be the
surface reaching a verdict by not looking, and *a missing artifact and a bad
verdict are different facts*. Every family is checked in that direction as well
as this one, because the direction a lazy build skips is that one.
