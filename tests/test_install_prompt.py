"""The board's half of the install-prompt guard, split by dependency direction.

`INSTALL.md` lives in the CORE repository and its prompt invokes both `wring`
and `wringer-board`. Neither repository can parse both: the core does not depend
on this package, and this package's tests can reach the core only when it is
importable.

So the guard is split, and **each half states what it does not cover rather
than quietly covering less than it looks**:

- the core's `test_docs.py` parses the `wring` lines, and skips the
  `wringer-board` ones with a named reason;
- this file parses the `wringer-board` lines with this package's real parser,
  and skips entirely — with a named reason — when the core repository is not
  beside it.

A `wringer-board` line that argparse would reject is a stranger's install
failing at the one step they cannot debug.
