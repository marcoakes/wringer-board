"""Guards on what this repository says about its own publication status.

**Why this file exists at all, and why it lives HERE rather than in the core.**

`wringer/docs/MANUAL_CHECKS.md:723-744` records this exact failure being
diagnosed once already: a sentence said *"the board has no remote, publication
is blocked"*, which was true of a local clone and false of the repository. The
correction landed in the core and **never reached this repository**, where the
same class of sentence stood until 2026-08-18 — so the defect is not a wrong
sentence, it is a fix that stopped at a repository boundary.

The structural answer is the one `test_install_prompt.py` already established:
**a cross-repository guard lives in the DEPENDENT repository and reaches
back**. This package imports `wringer`; the core does not import this package.
So this repository can check both sides and the core can only check one, which
is why both guards below are here.

Neither guard keeps a list of facts. The first reads `git remote get-url
origin` — this repository's real remote, from git, not from a fixture — and the
second reads the core's README on disk. A hand-kept list of what is published
is drift with extra steps, which is the thing being guarded against.

**What is deliberately NOT checked: PyPI.** Tests here send nothing over the
network. `wringer-board` genuinely is not on PyPI (404, checked 2026-08-18 by
hand and recorded in the finish report), and the README's PyPI clause is the
one clause of that sentence that was always true.
