    criterion, and its witness evidences nothing*. It is not any of the four —
    it is not unbound-with-nothing-else, not born green, not an unestablished
    pre-existence, and not a check that arrived with the work.

    rendered UNTRANSLATED with the engine's own words, which is what ruling 17
    prescribes for a reason the mapping does not cover, and then said in this
    docstring: *"Naming it a fifth cause with its own sentence is S2's job, not
    S1's. Recorded here so the next slice starts from a measured fact."*

    S2 did that. The cause is `witness-evidenced-nothing`, it has its own
    sentence in `refusals.MAPPING`, and the card is now NEEDS YOU rather than
    UNTRANSLATED. **This assertion is flipped on the authority of the sentence
    above it, in the commit that does the naming** — never quietly, because a
    pinned assertion is a record of a decision and reversing one silently is
    the defect this repository exists to catch.

    What has NOT changed, and is still asserted below: it never gets another
    cause's sentence. UNTRANSLATED was the honest answer while the mapping had
    no entry; it would be a wrong answer now, and the generic born-green
    sentence would have been a wrong answer in both slices.
