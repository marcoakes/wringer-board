"""The board reads `wringer.acceptance.v3` — taught from the ENGINE'S bytes.

**This file reads fixtures the core repository wrote and regenerates.**
`schema/fixtures/acceptance-v3-*.json` are produced by
`accept.Result.as_json_v3` and re-checked against it on every run of the core's
own suite, so they cannot drift from what the engine emits.

That is the whole reason Fable ruling H-1 sequenced the engine's v3 slices DARK
and taught this board afterwards, instead of teaching this board first. Writing
v3 fixtures here would have meant a reader and a fixture built from the same
author's guess — and this repository has already paid for that shape once:
eleven mutations walked through the absence guard because its fixtures agreed
with its reader rather than with reality.

If the engine is not importable these tests skip loudly, like the rest of the
cross-repo checks here.
