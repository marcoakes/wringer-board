"""Fixtures that build a repository the way the ENGINE writes one.

Hand-built rather than produced by running Wringer, and the trade is stated
rather than hidden: these fixtures are a second copy of the engine's output
shape, which is exactly the drift ruling 1 exists to refuse — so the real
guard is not here. It is `test_real_bundles.py`, which renders the bundles a
REAL corpus run wrote and fails if this board cannot read them. These fixtures
exist to reach the shapes a real run does not conveniently produce on demand:
a broken receipt chain, an unknown schema version, a born-green criterion.
